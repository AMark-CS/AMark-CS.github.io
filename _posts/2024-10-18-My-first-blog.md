Currently I am very satisfied with my life.
I have things that I like to do and I've also accomplished many things.
Also, I know exactly what to do in the future to reach my final goal! It is as if the road were right before my eyes and I can see it clearly.

So I think it is time to summarize how to deploy the page on windows:
1. modify the Gemfile to add the necessary packages.
2. commit the change to the 'gh-pages' branch
3. push the local 'gh-pages' to the remote 'gh-pages'
4. pull request for merging the branch gh-pages and the branch main
5. check the errors in action and ask gpt to solve them!
