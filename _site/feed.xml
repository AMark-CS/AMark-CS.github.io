I have things that I like to do and I’ve also accomplished many things.
Also, I know exactly what to do in the future to reach my final goal! It is as if the road were right before my eyes and I can see it clearly.</p>

<p>So I think it is time to summarize how to deploy the page on windows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>modify the Gemfile to add the necessary packages.</li>
  <li>commit the change to the ‘gh-pages’ branch</li>
  <li>push the local ‘gh-pages’ to the remote ‘gh-pages’</li>
  <li>pull request for merging the branch gh-pages and the branch main</li>
  <li>check the errors in action and ask gpt to solve them!</li>
