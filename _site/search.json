It is as if the road were right before my eyes and I can see it clearly.So I think it is time to summarize how to deploy the page on windows: modify the Gemfile to add the necessary packages. commit the change to the ‘gh-pages’ branch push the local ‘gh-pages’ to the remote ‘gh-pages’ pull request for merging the branch gh-pages and the branch main check the errors in action and ask gpt to solve them!"
